# COVID19_ARCGIS_WEBAPP_AND_DATA #

Created a arcgis webapp to summaries and map the covid-19 cases in Singapore. 
Click Here: https://lnkd.in/fydRuCA to access the webapp clicked. 

I also collated a datasetfrom MOH Website. Feel free to use or feedback on how to improve the dataset.

Do understand that public places mapped in the map are for awareness. They are perhaps the most sanitized places in Singapore right now and we should not avoid those places.
