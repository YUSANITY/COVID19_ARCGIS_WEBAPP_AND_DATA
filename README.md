# COVID19 ARCGIS WEBAPP AND DATA #

Created a arcgis webapp to summaries and map the covid-19 cases in Singapore. Do understand that public places mapped in the map are for awareness. They are perhaps the most sanitized places in Singapore right now and we should not avoid those places.

Click Here: https://lnkd.in/fydRuCA to access the webapp. 

Retired the application 2nd March 2020 as MOH has their official dashboard (here.)(https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/7e30edc490a5441a874f9efe67bd8b89)
